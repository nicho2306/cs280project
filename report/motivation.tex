Sending documents to others digitally has huge advantages over physical mail.
It is nearly instaneous, the recipient can easily share it with others, and you can often search through the document for particular words and phrases.
However, some things are still printed and sent physically including books, notes, and bills.
Therefore there is a need for the ability to turn physical papers into digital files.
For several decades this was accomplished with a special machine, the scanner, also sometimes integrated into high-end printers.

Recently cell-phone cameras have become much higher resolution.
This has enabled a new opportunity, to allow these camera's people have with them at all times to be turned into scanners.
The added convience will allow for the convience of digital transmission for all documents even without access to a potentially expensive and/or large scanner.

A cell-phone application can also offer an easy interface to the user.
Printers and scanners can be notoriously fussy so moving to an easy to update and change UI/UX could greatly improve the usability.
