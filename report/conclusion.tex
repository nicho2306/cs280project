\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}

Overall our algorithm is able to acheieve a 71\% accuracy rating on a diverse set of book and papers with interesting and varied backgrounds.
There are several particular failure modes that could be addressed with additional some heuristics.
We believe the algorithm remains useful as a cammer to scanner conversion despite these hiccups.
