\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Scanning documents has been a common practice for a long time.
Even before the advent of digital scanners faxes were a popular of sending documents to others.
But as smartphones have become more ubiquitous and fully featured they have begun to absorb many features of other electronics.

In this paper we present an algorithm for turning a simple smartphone camera, or any other camera, into a scanner.
The properties of a scanner we will replicate are: the page scanned fills the image, it is orientated with the top of the page at the top of the image, and that the ratio of the image is the same as that of the paper.

We first discuss previous work in this area in section~\ref{sec:related}.
We then describe our motivation for developing this tool in section~\ref{sec:motivate}.
Next, we introduce our multi-step algorithm with illustrations in section~\ref{sec:algorithm}.
Following this is a description of our experimental methodology and the results of applying the algorithm to a set of images in section~\ref{sec:results}.
Then, we discuss which images are problematic for our algorithm and potential solutions in section~\ref{sec:discuss}.
Finally, in section~\ref{sec:conclude} we conclude with an exploration of future work and highlight out successes.
