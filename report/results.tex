\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
We tested our algorithm on a set of 50 manually annotated images of books, and papers.
The image set had a variety of backgrounds, colors, and lighting.
We tuned the parameters of our algorithm across all the images such that for the final test run we used the same parameters for all images.

We categorized images as successes or failures based on the detected corners compared to the annotated corners.
Results that were within a small margin of the annotated corners counted as successes and otherwise were failures.
This resulted in an accuracy of 71\% in our image set.
In the following section we will discuss the failure modes of our algorithm.
