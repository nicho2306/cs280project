\begin{abstract}
In this paper we describe a method to turn ordinary pictures of books and papers into
scanner-like images.
This transforms and aligns the image such that the page takes up the entire viewing area.
This makes the image more readable and enables further processing such as character recognition.
We present the results of running our algorithm on a hand-annotated set of 50 images.
We discuss the successes failures and future work for our algorithm.
